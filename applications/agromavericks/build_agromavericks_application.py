SUMMARY = (
    "I am a full-stack developer and data analyst with hospital, programme management, "
    "and research experience. I am the Founder "
    "and Developer of HOSSPI (https://hosspi.com/), a hospital management platform connecting "
    "patient records, clinical workflows, billing, biomedical engineering, and live analytics. "
    "My software work also includes Shulekeeper, endoscopy reporting, Wekebere, and an AI "
    "reception agent deployed at a Texas law firm. As Biomedical Programs Manager at "
    "Gould Family Foundation (GFF), I led biomedical engineers and technicians across "
    "Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Malawi, Somaliland, and Rwanda. At IHK, I developed "
    "oxygen-consumption models and maintained compliance evidence; at UVRI, I analysed "
    "laboratory data and built Python research pipelines. My current FCHIP role at FairBanks "
    "combines software development with Python and SQL analysis, data-quality checks, "
    "and reporting dashboards."

## Why Agromavericks, and why are you the right person for this role?

I applied because Agromavericks is building real software for agricultural financing in Uganda, and you are growing an in-house tech team. That is the kind of work I want to do.

I have practical experience with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Native and Expo, Convex, Better Auth, Resend, WhatsApp messaging, Bunny.net, Vercel, and EAS, plus APIs, databases, authentication, testing, and CI/CD. As Founder and Developer of HOSSPI (https://hosspi.com/), I connect hospital workflows and live analytics. My other software work includes Shulekeeper, endoscopy reporting, Wekebere, and an AI reception agent deployed at a Texas law firm. My analytical background includes oxygen-demand modelling and compliance evidence at IHK, laboratory analysis and Python research pipelines at UVRI, and current FCHIP reporting at FairBanks using Python, SQL, data-quality checks, and dashboards.

As Biomedical Programs Manager at GFF, I led biomedical engineers and technicians across Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Malawi, Somaliland, and Rwanda. I trained engineering teams and clinical users, including doctors, nurses, and apprentices.

My biomedical work includes equipment inventory, planning, assessment, and technical advisory. At IHK, I upgraded theatre, laboratory, NICU, and oxygen plant and led 64-slice CT scanner and digital X-ray installation. At GFF, I led the NICU upgrade at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, and developed SOPs for supported equipment in partner facilities.

I live in Kampala, I can work in Uganda legally, and hybrid suits me. I would like to help keep the Agromavericks and Ukofi platforms stable and useful for farmers and financiers.
